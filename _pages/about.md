Hi, I'm Rebeca 🙋

### Work
I work as a Software Engineer at Vinta Software, we are a software studio based in Brazil. In the past, I've worked building and scaling web applications, but now my work is to build compliant health applications.

### Personal
For fun, I like go on surf trips around the world, watch surf competitions, and follow my hometown football [team](https://www.instagram.com/nauticope/)⚽🇵🇪. I go to the gym more days than not, read books and recently started a youtube channel to share my surf progress. You can find me all over the place, I'm always traveling and trying new things, you can easily find in Thailand doing a 3-month long Muay Thai training.
